# Hello, I'm Cam.

_[Links!](https://camrod.me/#links)_

## Wait a minute, where's your website?

Ah yeah, that old thing. I'm currently in the process of building a new website on GitHub Pages. The site was previously hosted on Squarespace, which was getting a little too expensive for my tastes...

## Ok, so when will the new site be ready?

Soonâ„¢. Jokes aside, I'll be working on the site over the holidays, so you should see progressive updates as I add pages and content.

## What will the new site look like?

You'll see! The main parts will be a simplified homepage, removing some outdated content, and potentially adding a blog. I've also considered hosting a personal Mastodon instance (wouldn't be sharing, sorry), but haven't committed to it yet.

## Cool. So what should I do in the meantime?

The good and the bad news is I didn't really update stuff a lot before, so you're not missing out on much. For now, check out my links below.
