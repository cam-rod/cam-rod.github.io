# Hello, I'm Cam.

_[Links!](https://camrod.me/#links)_

## Wait a minute, where's your website?

Ah yeah, that old thing. I'm currently in the process of building a new website on GitHub Pages. The site was previously hosted on Squarespace, which was getting a little too expensive for my tastes...

## Ok, so when will the new site be ready?

Soonâ„¢. Jokes aside, I'll be working on the site over the ~~holidays~~ next couple of months ðŸ«¥, so you should see progressive updates as I add pages and content.

## What will the new site look like?

You'll see! The main parts will be a simplified homepage, removing some outdated content, and potentially adding a blog. I've also considered hosting a personal Mastodon instance (wouldn't be sharing, sorry), but haven't committed to it yet.

## Cool. So what should I do in the meantime?

The good and the bad news is I didn't really update stuff a lot before, so you're not missing out on much. For now, check out my links below.

## Verification

Certain Git commits are signed by my SSH keys. That was kinda weird and not fully supported. Instead, I've created a new, stronger GPG keyset. It encompasses both emails I usually associate with my dev work, but the main address is `dev at camrod dot me`. Retrieve the matching GPG key and verify that the fingerprint is **`4DD2 0D5D F015 9663 DBC2 822A 4C56 9033 D552 7E72`**.

For completeness, I've cross-signed it with my older, unused keypair. That one is only associated with the address `rod dot cam2014 plus dev at gmail dot com`. The fingerprint is **`8174 914B 8B70 4F2B 5E18 29F7 9EC7 30E4 6905 A7A6`**.

For SSH authentication (and signed commits), you can find all of my keys [on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/cam-rod.keys). You might notice that one of those keys matches my GPG authentication subkey; those are the same key.
