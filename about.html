  </header>

  <h3>A computer engineering student.</h3>
  <p>I got my coding start in high school, with a somewhat brutal introduction to coding via Java. Luckily, the next
    year we used Python, and I was hooked. I also got to use a Raspberry Pi, kicking off my interest in hardware as
    well. I started my bachelor's at the University of Toronto, picking up C and C++ in software courses, and discovered
    Verilog and FPGAs (one of UofT's strengths) in hardware. Eventually I took these skills to my co-ops, a research
    position working on compression algorithms for FPGAs, and a year-long internship working on security
    at Red Hat.</p>
  <p>All the while, my interest kept me coding outside the classroom. I started off small: a (somewhat broken) <a
      href="https://github.com/cam-rod/TI84-colour-physics-bible">physics program for the TI-84</a>, a patch for a
    Reddit moderation bot. Then came my first big project: <code><a href="https://github.com/cam-rod/XKCDAltTextBot">XKCDAltTextBot</a></code>,
    a script that brought the follow-up joke of the popular webcomic to Twitter. I dove into the challenge, even
    refusing to use Tweepy so that I could learn the API calls myself. I'd use this project in my university
    applications, and continued to update it until Heroku shut down the free tier, and Twitter siloed itself.</p>
  <p>Since then, I've continued to experiment. I joined <a href="https://www.utat.ca/">UTAT</a> and wrote software for
    microcontrollers, eventually becoming the Firmware system lead. I opened numerous PRs after gaining experience at
    Red Hat, and even got my RHCSA certification. Of course, I kept learning new things like Rust, GraphQL, and
    JavaScript as I went.</p>

  <h3>A nerd.</h3>
  <p><em>Complete shocker.</em> I follow new technology, and experiment with unique or interesting stuff. Whether it's
    trying to create a breadboard circuit, or patching a bug myself, I prefer to get hands-on. I also like to discover
    how gadgets work, and sometimes that means taking apart and putting it back together well enough. Oddly enough, I'm
    half-decent at writing, which is why this is the 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph on the page.</p>

  <h3>An explorer.</h3>
  <p>It's not just computer mice and phones that I like to take apart â€” I hunt for the ideas, decisions, and designs
    behind the world as it is, physical and human. Less philosophically, I enjoy outdoor sports like cycling, skiing,
    and kayaking. My gear isn't great (yet), but that's not gonna stop me from getting out there when I can.</p>
  <p>I also love communities. I spent years as a moderator of the Google Pixel and Android subreddits, and was a regular
    in the mailing list and Stack Overflow tags at Red Hat. I've also led a few different groups, volunteered at various
    events, and look forward to doing more work in the community.</p>
