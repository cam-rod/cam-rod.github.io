  <h1>Who is Cameron?</h1>
</header>

<h2>A computer engineering student.</h2>
<p>I got my start in high school, with a somewhat brutal introduction to coding via Java. Luckily, the next
  year we used Python, and I was hooked. We were handed Raspberry Pis, kicking off my interest in hardware as
  well. I started my undergrad at the University of Toronto, picking up C and C++ in software project, and discovering
  Verilog through hardware courses. Eventually I took these skills to a research position working on compression
  algorithms for FPGAs, and a year-long internship working on security at Red Hat.</p>
<p>All the while, I kept coding outside the classroom. I started off small: a (somewhat broken) <a
      href="https://github.com/cam-rod/TI84-colour-physics-bible">physics program for the TI-84</a>, a patch for a
  Reddit moderation bot. Then came my first big project: <code><a href="https://github.com/cam-rod/XKCDAltTextBot">XKCDAltTextBot</a></code>,
  a script that brought the follow-up joke of the popular webcomic to Twitter. I dove into the challenge, even
  refusing to use Tweepy so that I could learn the API calls myself. More than a test of skill, it become one of my most
  popular projects, and I kept improving it for the next 3 years, until API changes forced me to shut the app down.</p>
<p>Since then, I've continued to experiment. I joined <a href="https://www.utat.ca/">UTAT</a> and wrote software for
  microcontrollers, eventually becoming the Firmware system lead. I contributed to numerous projects while gaining
  experience at Red Hat, and even got my RHCSA certification. Of course, I kept learning new things like Rust, GraphQL,
  and JavaScript as I went.</p>

<h2>A nerd.</h2>
<p><em>Complete shocker.</em> I follow new technology, and experiment with unique or interesting stuff. Whether it's
  trying to create a breadboard circuit, or patching a bug myself, I prefer to get hands-on. I also like to discover
  how gadgets work, and sometimes that means taking apart and putting it back together well enough. And occasionally I
  like writing, which is why this is the 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph so far.</p>
<p>I also love communities. I spent years as a moderator of the Google Pixel and Android subreddits, and was a regular
  in the mailing lists and on Stack Overflow at Red Hat. I've also led a mix of teams and volunteered at various
  events.</p>

<h2>An explorer.</h2>
<p>It's not just computer mice and phones that I like to take apart â€” I'm a huge fan of design and learning about the
  decisions behind the physical and social world. I also enjoy outdoor sports like cycling, skiing, and kayaking.</p>
