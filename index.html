    <p><i><a href="#links">Shortcut to the links!</a></i></p>

    <p>
      <strong>Wait a minute, where's your website?</strong><br>
      Ah yeah, that old thing. I'm currently in the process of building a new website on GitHub Pages. The site was previously hosted on Squarespace, which was getting a little too expensive for what I need. I also wanted to get a bit more practice with HTML/CSS/JS, after updating the <a href="https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/">WildFly Elytron site</a> for Grace Hopper Conference's Open Source Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ok, so when will the new site be ready?</strong><br>
      Soonâ„¢. Jokes aside, I'll be working on the site over the next few weeks, so you should see progressive updates as I add pages and content. If you're seeing this, it means I've actually started!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What will the new site look like?</strong><br>
      You'll see! The main parts will be a simplified homepage, removing some outdated content, and a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cool. So what should I do in the meantime?</strong><br>
      Check out my links below. Most of my activity will be there.

    <p>My GPG keyring can be downloaded from the Ubuntu keyserver (<em>dev at camrod dot me</em>) or from <a href="https://envs.net/~camrod/files/keys/4DD20D5DF0159663DBC2822A4C569033D5527E72.gpg.asc">my profile on envs.net</a>. <strong>Fingerprint:</strong> <code>4DD2 0D5D F015 9663 DBC2 822A 4C56 9033 D552 7E72</code></p>

    <p>I have an older keyring, used until early 2022. It's still secure, and I've cross-signed it with my current key. It's also on the Ubuntu keyserver (<em>rod dot cam2014 plus dev at gmail dot com</em>) and <a href="https://envs.net/~camrod/files/keys/8174914B8B704F2B5E1829F79EC730E46905A7A6.gpg.asc">envs.net</a>. <strong>Fingerprint:</strong> <code>8174 914B 8B70 4F2B 5E18 29F7 9EC7 30E4 6905 A7A6</code></p>

    <p>For SSH authentication (and a few signed commits from 2022), you can find all of my keys <a href="https://github.com/cam-rod.keys" target="_blank">on my GitHub profile</a>. You might notice that one of those matches my current GPG authentication subkey; those are the same key.</p>
