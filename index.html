    <p>
      <strong>Wait a minute, where's your website?</strong><br>
      Ah yeah, that old thing. I'm currently in the process of building a new website on GitHub Pages. The site was previously hosted on Squarespace, which was getting a little too expensive for my tastes...
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ok, so when will the new site be ready?</strong><br>
      Soonâ„¢. Jokes aside, I'll be working on the site over the <s>holidays</s> next couple of months ðŸ«¥, so you should see progressive updates as I add pages and content. If you're seeing this, it means I've actually started!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What will the new site look like?</strong><br>
      You'll see! The main parts will be a simplified homepage, removing some outdated content, and a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cool. So what should I do in the meantime?</strong><br>
      Check out my links below. Most of my activity will be there.

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/cam-rod">GitHub</a> - coding for work and fun</li>
      <li><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/cam-rod">LinkedIn</a> - documenting my professional and volunteer experience</li>
      <li><a href="https://camrod.me/fediverse">@camrod@camrod.me</a> - permalink to my fediverse account, currently a Mastodon instance at techhub.social</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">My email</a> - humans, check the next section.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/cam-rod/cam-rod.github.io">cam-rod.github.io</a> - watch this website get built!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Verification</h2>

    <p>Certain Git commits are signed by my SSH keys. That was kinda weird and not fully supported. Instead, I've created a new, stronger GPG keyset. It encompasses both emails I usually associate with my dev work, but the main address is <code>dev at camrod dot me</code>. Retrieve the matching GPG key and verify that the fingerprint is <strong><code>4DD2 0D5D F015 9663 DBC2 822A 4C56 9033 D552 7E72</code></strong>.</p>

    <p>For completeness, I've cross-signed it with my older, unused keypair. That one is only associated with the address <code>rod dot cam2014 plus dev at gmail dot com</code>. The fingerprint is <strong><code>8174 914B 8B70 4F2B 5E18 29F7 9EC7 30E4 6905 A7A6</code></strong>.</p>
    
    <p>For SSH authentication (and signed commits), you can find all of my keys <a href="https://github.com/cam-rod.keys" target="_blank">on my GitHub profile</a>. You might notice that one of those keys matches my GPG authentication subkey; those are the same key.</p>
